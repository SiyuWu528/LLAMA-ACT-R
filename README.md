# LLAMA-ACT-R
This ongoing project aims to develop a novel hybrid architecture called LLAMA-ACT-R designed to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in decision-making.

## Project Overview
LLAMA-ACT-R leveras a well-established neural-symbolic AI system---the ACT-R cognitive architecture. ACT-R is an integrated theory of the mind, realized as a neural-symbolic AI that encompasses perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. It is used to develop synthetic agents for learning and training. LLAMA-ACT-R will use fine-tuned ACT-R models, trained on several tasks, to inform the final embedding layer of an LLM. This process combines human-like decision-making patterns and learning curves with an LLM, enabling the resulting system to make decisions and learn in a way that more closely mimics human behavior.
